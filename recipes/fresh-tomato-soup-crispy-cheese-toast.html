    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We're doing a very fresh twist on the classic cream of tomato soup with a
       grilled cheese sandwich. Since we're using fresh tomatoes at their peak
       of vine-ripened goodness, this simple soup is going to be not quite, but
       almost, 100% tomato.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class = "ingredients">
      <li>3 ½ pounds vine-ripened tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
      <li>8 slices Italian bread</li>
      <li>¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves</li>
      <li>6 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class = "steps">
      <li>Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat</li>
      <li>Add garlic and anchovy and cook until garlic is sizzling in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute</li>
      <li>Carefully add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, and red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Toss with a spoon every few minutes until the tomatoes release their liquid and start to break down</li>
      <li>Once the tomatoes have softened and start to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with foil or a silicone liner. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>Place the bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Top each slice with sliced basil, and then Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is well browned and crispy around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl</li>
      <li>Use the back of a ladle to push all the tomato mixture through</li>
      <li>Discard the skins and seeds, which should be the only things left in the strainer</li>
      <li>Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat</li>
      <li>ontinue cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately with the cheese toast</li>
    </ol>
